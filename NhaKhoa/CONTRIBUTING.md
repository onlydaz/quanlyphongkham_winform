# Contributing to NhaKhoa

Thank you for contributing to the NhaKhoa project. This document describes the workflow, standards, and steps to upload code to GitHub and contribute changes.

## Guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused. Open a separate branch per feature/bugfix.
- Follow the project's coding style and formatting rules. This repository uses an `.editorconfig` file to enforce formatting. Ensure your IDE respects `.editorconfig`.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Use imperative tense and a short summary line.

## Branching and Naming

- Use `main` as the default protected branch.
- Create feature branches with the pattern: `feature/<short-description>`
- Create bugfix branches with the pattern: `fix/<short-description>`
- Create release or hotfix branches as needed.

## Commit Message Format
